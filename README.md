# Real-Estate-Management-System

We developed a web application for managing real estates. Using this website, users can search real estates for buying or renting. Also, there is an option for builders to upload information about real estates for selling. The builder can provide different information about the property like total area, type of flat, cost per square feet etc. Finally, when user books a property, an appointment is scheduled between builder and the buyer. This was implemented by sending an email to both of them. PHP was used for developing backend scripts and the database was designed using MySQL.
